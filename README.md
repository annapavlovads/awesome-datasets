# Document processing

Documents are an essential part of many businesses in many fields such as law, finance and technology, among others. Automatic processing of documents such as invoices, contracts and resumes is lucrative and opens up many new business avenues. The fields of natural language processing and computer vision have seen considerable progress with the development of deep learning, so these methods have begun to be incorporated into contemporary document understanding systems.

Here is a curated list of datasets for intelligent document processing.

## Document Classification

### English

- [RVL-CDIP Dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aharley/rvl-cdip/) The RVL-CDIP dataset consists of 400,000 grayscale images in 16 classes (letter, memo, email, file folder, form, handwritten, invoice, advertisement, budget, news article, presentation, scientific
publication, questionnaire, resume, scientific report, specification), with 25,000 images per class.

## Key Information Extraction

### English

- [CORD](https://github.com/clovaai/cord) The dataset consists of thousands of Indonesian receipts, which contains images and box/text annotations for OCR, and multi-level semantic labels for parsing. Labels are the bouding box position and the text of the key informations.

- [FUNSD](https://guillaumejaume.github.io/FUNSD/) A dataset for Text Detection, Optical Character Recognition, Spatial Layout Analysis and Form Understanding. Its consists of 199 fully annotated forms, 31485 words, 9707 semantic entities, 5304 relations.

- [SROIE](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ShItNWXyiY1tFDM5W02bceHuJjyeeJl2) Consists of a dataset with 1000 whole scanned receipt images and annotations for the competition on scanned receipts OCR and key information extraction (SROIE). Labels are the bouding box position and the text of the key informations.
