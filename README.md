Question-Answer Datasets for Chatbot Training

- [AmbigQA](https://nlp.cs.washington.edu/ambigqa/) is a new open-domain question answering task that consists of predicting a set of question and answer pairs, where each plausible answer is associated with a disambiguated rewriting of the original question. The data set covers 14,042 open-ended QI-open questions.

- [Break](https://allenai.github.io/Break/) is a set of data for understanding issues, aimed at training models to reason about complex issues. It consists of 83,978 natural language questions, annotated with a new meaning representation, the Question Decomposition Meaning Representation (QDMR). Each example includes the natural question and its QDMR representation.

- [CommonsenseQA](https://www.tau-nlp.org/commonsenseqa) is a set of multiple-choice question answer data that requires different types of common sense knowledge to predict the correct answers . It contains 12,102 questions with one correct answer and four distracting answers. The data set is provided in two main training/validation/test sets: "random assignment", which is the main evaluation assignment, and "question token assignment".

- [CoQA](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/coqa/) is a large-scale data set for the construction of conversational question answering systems. The CoQA contains 127,000 questions with answers, obtained from 8,000 conversations involving text passages from seven different domains.

- [DROP](https://allennlp.org/drop) is a 96-question repository, created by the opposing party, in which a system must resolve references in a question, perhaps to multiple input positions, and perform discrete operations on them (such as adding, counting or sorting). These operations require a much more complete understanding of paragraph content than was required for previous data sets.

- [DuReader 2.0](https://ai.baidu.com/broad/subordinate?dataset=dureader) is a large-scale, open-domain Chinese data set for reading comprehension (RK) and question answering (QA). It contains over 300K questions, 1.4M obvious documents and corresponding human-generated answers.

- [HotpotQA](https://hotpotqa.github.io/) is a set of question response data that includes natural multi-skip questions, with a strong emphasis on supporting facts to allow for more explicit question answering systems. The data set consists of 113,000 Wikipedia-based QA pairs.

- [NarrativeQA](https://github.com/deepmind/narrativeqa) is a data set constructed to encourage deeper understanding of language. This dataset involves reasoning about reading whole books or movie scripts. This dataset contains approximately 45,000 pairs of free text question-and-answer pairs. There are two modes of understanding this dataset: (1) reading comprehension on summaries and (2) reading comprehension on whole books/scripts.

- [Natural Questions (NQ)](https://ai.google.com/research/NaturalQuestions), a new large-scale corpus for training and evaluating open-ended question answering systems, and the first to replicate the end-to-end process in which people find answers to questions. NQ is a large corpus, consisting of 300,000 questions of natural origin, as well as human-annotated answers from Wikipedia pages, for use in training in quality assurance systems. In addition, we have included 16,000 examples where the answers (to the same questions) are provided by 5 different annotators, useful for evaluating the performance of the QA systems learned.

- The objective of the [NewsQA](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/newsqa-dataset) dataset is to help the research community build algorithms capable of answering questions that require human-scale understanding and reasoning skills. Based on CNN articles from the DeepMind Q&A database, we have prepared a Reading Comprehension dataset of 120,000 pairs of questions and answers.

- [OpenBookQA](https://github.com/allenai/OpenBookQA), inspired by open-book exams to assess human understanding of a subject. The open book that accompanies our questions is a set of 1329 elementary level scientific facts. Approximately 6,000 questions focus on understanding these facts and applying them to new situations.

- [QASC](https://github.com/allenai/qasc) is a question-and-answer data set that focuses on sentence composition. It consists of 9,980 8-channel multiple-choice questions on elementary school science (8,134 train, 926 dev, 920 test), and is accompanied by a corpus of 17M sentences.

- [QuAC](https://quac.ai/), a data set for answering questions in context that contains 14K information-seeking QI dialogues (100K questions in total). Question Answering in Context is a dataset for modeling, understanding, and participating in information-seeking dialogues. The data instances consist of an interactive dialogue between two crowd workers: (1) a student who asks a sequence of free questions to learn as much as possible about a hidden Wikipedia text, and (2) a teacher who answers the questions by providing short excerpts (staves) of the text. QuAC introduces challenges not found in existing machine comprehension data sets: its questions are often more open-ended, unanswered, or only meaningful in the context of dialogue.

- [Question-and-answer dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/QA-data/): This corpus includes Wikipedia articles, factual questions manually generated from them, and answers to these manually generated questions for use in academic research.

- A set of [Quora questions](https://data.quora.com/First-Quora-Dataset-Release-Question-Pairs) to determine whether pairs of question texts actually correspond to semantically equivalent queries. More than 400,000 lines of potential questions duplicate question pairs.

- [RecipeQA](https://hucvl.github.io/recipeqa/) is a set of data for multimodal understanding of recipes. It consists of more than 36,000 pairs of automatically generated questions and answers from approximately 20,000 unique recipes with step-by-step instructions and images. Each RecipeQA question involves multiple modalities such as titles, descriptions or images, and working towards an answer requires (i) a common understanding of images and text, (ii) capturing the temporal flow of events, and (iii) understanding procedural knowledge.

- [The Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD)](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) is a set of reading comprehension data consisting of questions asked by social workers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to each question is a segment of text, or span, of the corresponding reading passage. With more than 100,000 question-answer pairs on more than 500 articles, SQuAD is significantly larger than previous reading comprehension datasets. SQuAD2.0 combines the 100,000 questions from SQuAD1.1 with more than 50,000 new unanswered questions written in a contradictory manner by crowd workers to look like answered questions.

- [TREC QA Collection](https://trec.nist.gov/data/qa.html): TREC has had a track record of answering questions since 1999. In each track, the task was defined so that systems had to retrieve small fragments of text containing an answer to open-domain and closed-domain questions.

- [TyDi QA](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/tydiqa) is a set of question response data covering 11 typologically diverse languages with 204K question-answer pairs. The languages in TyDi QA are diverse in terms of their typology -- the set of linguistic characteristics that each language expresses -- so we expect that the models performing on this set will be generalizable to a large number of languages around the world. It contains linguistic phenomena that would not be found in English-only corpora.

- [The WikiQA corpus](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/mobile/download.aspx?p=4495da01-db8c-4041-a7f6-7984a4f6a905): A set of publicly available pairs of questions and phrases collected and annotated for research on the answer to open-domain questions. In order to reflect the true information needs of general users, they used Bing query logs as a source of questions. Each question is linked to a Wikipedia page that potentially contains the answer.

- [Yahoo Language Data](https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=l): This page presents manually maintained QA datasets from Yahoo responses.

### Voice of Customer

- [Amazon Product Data](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/) Amazon product data is a subset of a large 142.8 million Amazon review dataset that was made available by Stanford professor, Julian McAuley. This sentiment analysis dataset contains reviews from May 1996 to July 2014. The dataset reviews include ratings, text, helpfull votes, product description, category information, price, brand, and image features.

- [Stanford Sentiment Treebank](https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/code.html) This dataset contains just over 10,000 pieces of Stanford data from HTML files of Rotten Tomatoes. The sentiments are rated between 1 and 25, where one is the most negative and 25 is the most positive. The deep learning model by Stanford has been built on the representation of sentences based on the sentence structure instead just giving points based on the positive and negative words. 

- [Multi-Domain Sentiment Dataset](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/datasets/sentiment/) This dataset contains positive and negative files for thousands of Amazon products. Although the reviews are for older products, this data set is excellent to use. The data derives from the Department of Computer Science at John Hopkins University.

- [IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/imdb-movie-reviews-dataset) This large movie dataset contains a collection of about 50,000 movie reviews from IMDB. In this dataset, only highly polarised reviews are being considered. The positive and negative reviews are even in number; however, the negative review has a score of â‰¤ 4 out of 10, and the positive review has a score of â‰¥ 7 out of 10.

- [Sentiment140](http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students) Sentiment140 is used to discover the sentiment of a brand or product or even a topic on the social media platform Twitter. Rather than working on keywords-based approach, which leverages high precision for lower recall, Sentiment140 works with classifiers built from machine learning algorithms. The Sentiment140 uses classification results for individual tweets along with the traditional surface that aggregated metrics. The Sentiment140 is used for brand management, polling, and planning a purchase.

- [Twitter US Airline Sentiment](https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment) This sentiment analysis dataset contains tweets since Feb 2015 about each of the major US airline. Each tweet is classified either positive, negative or neutral. The included features including Twitter ID, sentiment confidence score, sentiments, negative reasons, airline name, retweet count, name, tweet text, tweet coordinates, date and time of the tweet, and the location of the tweet.

- [Paper Reviews Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Paper+Reviews) Paper Reviews Data Set contains reviews from English and Spanish languages on computing and informatics conferences. The algorithm used will predict the opinions of academic paper reviews. Most of the dataset for the sentiment analysis of this type is sent in Spanish. It has a total of instances of N=405 evaluated with a 5-point scale, -2: very negative, -1: neutral, 1: positive, 2: very positive. The distribution of the scores is uniform, and there exists a difference between the way the paper is evaluated and the review written by the original reviewer.

- [Sentiment Lexicons For 81 Languages](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/sentiment-lexicons-for-81-languages) Sentiment Lexicons for 81 Languages contains languages from Afrikaans to Yiddish. This data includes both positive and negative sentiment lexicons for a total of 81 languages. These lexica were generated via graph propagation for the sentiment analysis based on a knowledge graph which is a graphical representation of real-world objects and the relationship between them. The general idea is that words closely linked on a knowledge graph may have similar sentiment polarities. The sentiments were built based on English sentiment lexicons.

- [Lexicoder Sentiment Dictionary](http://www.lexicoder.com/) This dataset for the sentiment analysis is designed to be used within the Lexicoder, which performs the content analysis. This dictionary consists of 2,858 negative sentiment words and 1,709 positive sentiment words. In addition to that, 2,860 negations of negative and 1,721 positive words are also included. Anyone willing to test this is advised by the developers to subtract negated positive words from positive counts and subtract the negated negative words from the negative count.

- [Opin-Rank Review Dataset](https://github.com/kavgan/OpinRank) Opin-Rank Review Dataset contains full reviews on cars and hotels. This data set includes about 2,59,000 hotel reviews and 42,230 car reviews collected from TripAdvisor and Edmunds, respectively. The car dataset has the models from 2007, 2008, 2009 and has about 140-250 cars from each year. The fields include dates, favourites, author names, and full review in text. The dataset contains information from 10 different cities which include Dubai, Beijing, Las Vegas, San Fransisco, etc. There are reviews of about 80-700 hotels from each city.

### Wildfire detection 

- [1.88 Million US Wildfires](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires) This data publication contains a spatial database of wildfires that occurred in the United States from 1992 to 2015. It is the third update of a publication originally generated to support the national Fire Program Analysis (FPA) system. The wildfire records were acquired from the reporting systems of federal, state, and local fire organizations. The following core data elements were required for records to be included in this data publication: discovery date, final fire size, and a point location at least as precise as Public Land Survey System (PLSS) section (1-square mile grid). The data were transformed to conform, when possible, to the data standards of the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG). Basic error-checking was performed and redundant records were identified and removed, to the degree possible. The resulting product, referred to as the Fire Program Analysis fire-occurrence database (FPA FOD), includes 1.88 million geo-referenced wildfire records, representing a total of 140 million acres burned during the 24-year period.
